# FAQ

## What is an account?
A BananaCrumbs ID allows you to use BananaCrumbs-owned and BananaCrumbs-partnered services.  The ID itself is a
twenty-four (24) number ID, along with an MFA token, which will be used by our services to validate your account.

## My account details were compromised!  How do I get my time back?
You can have your account details changed in the event of a paid compromised account.  If your account
does not have any time left on it, it cannot be changed.

You can contact **support@bananacrumbs.us** for help.  We require an invoice email or other proof that you
own this account, otherwise we will not be able to transfer your account number.

When we transfer your account, we will email you a copy of your NEW account number & MFA token.

## Can I get a refund for a service?
In the event you accidentally entered the wrong BananaCrumbs ID to upgrade, a refund will be processed automatically.

A refund will only be issued if required by law in your jurisdiction.  Please read the Terms of Service
for more information: https://bananacrumbs.us/terms-of-service

## Can I resell BananaCrumbs services?
Currently, we do not offer any methods for reselling products.  We may provide one in the future, so
be sure to check back soon!
