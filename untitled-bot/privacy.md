# Untitled-bot Privacy Policy

We are aiming to be as privacy-respecting as possible, while still maintaining user functionality, that’s why we’ve made a privacy policy which everyone can read.  Please note that untitled-bot is a bot for Discord; however, we are not affiliated with Discord or any of their partners/associates.


### Data Collection
We collect the following data on users:
-	Discord user ID.
-	Discord guild (commonly known as a server) ID.
-	Image data uploaded by users, such as:
  - Rank card image backgrounds,
  - Images which have been uploaded through filters on our bot,
-	Data collected for bot functionality
  -	Experience points (given by each Discord message sent in the same server the bot is in)
  -	User rank level (given by the amount of experience points a user has)
  -	Configuration (such as changing your preferences on the bot)
  -	AI credits (credits purchased to allow you to use our AI services)
-	Discord user avatar (profile picture) links (to add your avatar to a rank card)
-	Discord usernames (including a discriminator, such as #0123)
-	Discord guild/server names (for the rank leaderboard in the `top` command)

Please note that images which are outputted through our filter are stored on our server, as well as images generated through Artificial Intelligence.  Images which are inputted to our filter are only used once to modify, and are not stored on our end.

Discord does not send message content to untitled-bot; however, we receive when a user sends a message to increase a user’s experience points, but is not stored persistently on our server.

### Data Sharing
Unless required by law or by Discord, we will not share any data of our users with any third party, unless in the event of a merger.

Untitled-bot is under the jurisdiction of Phoenix, Arizona, and the United States of America, in Maricopa County.
